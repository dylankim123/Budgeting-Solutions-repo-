BudgetBuddy: A computer program designed to help monitor spending habits and construct a budget around
your current income.It allows users to create their own usernames, track monthly income and outgoing expenses, classify expenses, calculate after-tax income, and identify trends in expenditure. All data is recorded to local files for monitoring and analysis in the long run.

Domain Focus: Personal Finance or Financial Technology
Problem Statement: 
Listed below are problems that people often struggle with:
1. Staying on a consistent saving schedule
2. complex budgeting applications
3. Lack of spending awareness
4. Remembering to pay cards/improving credit score
5. Building a budget in general
These problems arise when people do not have access to resources or systems for tracking income, categorizing expenses, calculating taxes, or identifying spending patterns of excess, resulting in ineffective methods of organizing their monthly budgets and expenses. Therefore, BudgetBuddy solves this by offering a simple, local, Python-based solution that allows users to:
- Create and manage specific usernames
- Log monthly income and spending
- Categorize expenses for better analysis
- Calculate available income after taxes
- Track and store monthly spending records

Installation and Setup: 
1. Access our repository link (submitted in the Project 01: Function Library Assignment)
2. Enter the src folder, and click on the file named "Function_Library.py"
3. Create a python virtual environment that allows users to run their code (VS Code)
4. Copy and paste all functions in the function_library.py file, and run the code. Respond in the terminal in order for the code to work and be utilized.
