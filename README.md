Problem Statement: 
Listed below are problems that people often struggle with:
1. Staying on a consistent saving schedule
2. complex budgeting applications
3. Lack of spending awareness
4. Remembering to pay cards/improving credit score
5. Building a budget in general
These problems arise when people do not have access to resources or systems for tracking income, categorizing expenses, calculating taxes, or identifying spending patterns of excess, resulting in ineffective methods of organizing their monthly budgets and expenses. Therefore, BudgetBuddy solves this by offering a simple, local, Python-based solution that allows users to:
- Create and manage specific usernames
- Log monthly income and spending
- Categorize expenses for better analysis
- Calculate available income after taxes
- Track and store monthly spending records
